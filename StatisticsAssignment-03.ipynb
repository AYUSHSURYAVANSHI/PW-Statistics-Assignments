    "# # Q.1 What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "# Answer:-A Probability Density Function (PDF) is a statistical concept used in probability theory and statistics to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It defines the likelihood of the random variable taking on a particular value within a given range.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In mathematical terms, a PDF is typically represented by a function, often denoted as f(x), where \"x\" represents the possible values of the random variable. The PDF has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-negativity: The PDF is non-negative for all values of x, meaning f(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Integration over the entire range: The integral of the PDF over its entire range equals 1, which reflects the fact that the total probability of all possible outcomes is 1. Mathematically, this property is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ∫ f(x) dx = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability within a range: The probability that the random variable falls within a specific range [a, b] is given by the integral of the PDF over that range:\n",
    "\n",
    "# P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n",
    "\n",
    "# The PDF is commonly used in continuous probability distributions like the normal distribution, exponential distribution, and many others. It helps you determine the likelihood of observing a particular value or range of values for a continuous random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, in the case of the normal distribution, the PDF is represented by the bell-shaped curve, and it tells you the probability of the random variable taking on a particular value or being within a particular range of values.\n",
    "\n",

    "# # Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?\n",
    "# Answer :-There are several types of probability distributions used in probability theory and statistics to model and describe the behavior of random variables. The choice of distribution depends on the nature of the data and the underlying processes being analyzed. Here are some common types of probability distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Uniform Distribution: In a uniform distribution, all values in the sample space are equally likely. It is often used when each outcome has an equal chance of occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bernoulli Distribution: The Bernoulli distribution models a random experiment with two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) and failure (usually denoted as 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution is used to model the number of successful outcomes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials. It's often used for problems involving a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space when these events happen at a known average rate and are independent of the time since the last event.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): The normal distribution is one of the most important and widely used distributions. It has a bell-shaped curve and is characterized by its mean and standard deviation. Many natural phenomena and measurements tend to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exponential Distribution: The exponential distribution is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process. It is commonly used in reliability analysis and queuing theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Geometric Distribution: The geometric distribution models the number of Bernoulli trials needed for the first success to occur. It's used to describe the waiting time for a success in a series of independent trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gamma Distribution: The gamma distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions that generalizes the exponential distribution. It's often used to model waiting times, such as the time until the arrival of a fixed number of events in a Poisson process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Beta Distribution: The beta distribution is a continuous probability distribution defined on the interval [0, 1]. It's often used to model the distribution of random variables constrained to a finite range, such as probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chi-Squared Distribution: The chi-squared distribution is used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, particularly when dealing with sample variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Student's t-Distribution: The t-distribution is commonly used for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals when the sample size is small, and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
