    "# Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order.

The median is less affected by extreme values and is often used when dealing with skewed distributions.\n",

They provide information about how much the individual data points deviate from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode) and how widely the values are distributed.

    "# Covariance is a measure that indicates the degree to which two variables change together. It quantifies the extent of the joint variability between two variables. A positive covariance suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, while a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. If the covariance is close to zero, it suggests that there is little to no linear relationship between the variables.\n",

Unlike covariance, correlation is independent of the scale of the variables and allows for direct comparison between different datasets.\n",

Nevertheless, the measures of central tendency in a normal distribution are still very close to each other due to the nature of the distribution."

    "# Scale:\n",
    "# Covariance is not standardized and is influenced by the scale of the variables being measured. The magnitude of covariance is not easily interpretable or comparable across different datasets with different units of measurement. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the strength of the relationship between variables based on covariance alone.\n",

    "# Correlation, being standardized, provides a clearer interpretation of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the linear relationship, while the sign (positive or negative) indicates the direction.\n",
    "# Range:\n",
    "# Covariance has no predetermined range and can take any value, positive or negative.\n",
    "# Correlation always ranges between -1 and +1. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "# In summary, covariance measures the joint variability between two variables, but it is not standardized and does not provide a clear interpretation of the strength of the relationship.

    "# Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "# Answer :-\n",
    "# Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion, leading to potential distortions in the summary statistics. Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of the data, either being unusually high or low compared to the majority of the observations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode):\n",

    "# Median: The median is less affected by outliers because it is not influenced by the actual values of the outliers, only their relative positions in the data when arranged in ascending or descending order. However, if there are multiple outliers on one side of the data, the median may shift slightly towards that side.\n",
    "# Mode: Outliers do not directly impact the mode, as it represents the most frequent value in the dataset. However, if an outlier appears multiple times, it could create a new mode or increase the frequency of an existing one.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Measures of Dispersion (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range):\n",
    "# Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can substantially increase the variability in the dataset, leading to larger values for variance and standard deviation. These measures quantify the spread of data around the central tendency, so the presence of outliers tends to increase the dispersion.\n",
    "# Range: The presence of outliers can significantly affect the range as it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Outliers can substantially expand the range, indicating a wider spread of data points.\n",
    "# In summary, outliers can skew measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and increase measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range). Therefore, it is essential to be cautious when interpreting summary statistics in the presence of outliers and consider their impact on the overall data characteristics. Outliers should be identified and analyzed carefully to understand their influence on statistical analysis and make informed decisions about their treatment, such as considering their removal or using robust statistical methods.\n",
