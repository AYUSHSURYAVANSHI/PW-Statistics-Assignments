    "# #  Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "# Answer :-\n",
    "# Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating population parameters based on sample data. It involves making educated guesses or estimates about the true characteristics of a population using information from a subset of that population, which is the sample. Two common approaches to estimation in statistics are point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Point Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A point estimate is a single value that is used to approximate the true value of a population parameter. It provides a single best guess of the parameter's value based on the sample data.\n",
    "# Point estimates are often denoted by symbols such as \"x̄\" (pronounced as \"x-bar\") for the sample mean, \"p̂\" (pronounced as \"p-hat\") for the sample proportion, or \"s\" for the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "# For example, if you want to estimate the population mean income of a city, you might take a random sample of individuals and calculate the sample mean income as your point estimate of the population mean income.\n",
    "# Interval Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "# An interval estimate, on the other hand, provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. It takes into account the uncertainty associated with estimating the parameter.\n",
    "# The most common form of interval estimate is the confidence interval. A confidence interval provides a lower and upper bound between which the parameter is estimated to lie with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval).\n",
    "# For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean income might be stated as: \"We are 95% confident that the true population mean income falls within the range of $40,000 to $50,000.\""

    "# Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics that involves a formal procedure for making decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It is used to evaluate specific claims or hypotheses about these parameters. Hypothesis testing is a structured process that helps researchers and analysts draw conclusions, make informed decisions, and assess the validity of their beliefs regarding the population under study.\n",

    "# Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents what you are trying to establish or prove through your analysis. It often asserts the presence of an effect, difference, or relationship.\n",

    "# Test Statistic: A test statistic is a numerical value computed from the sample data. It quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. The choice of test statistic depends on the specific hypothesis test being conducted (e.g., t-statistic, z-statistic, chi-squared statistic).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Significance Level (α): The significance level, denoted as α, represents the probability of making a Type I error, which is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common significance levels include 0.05 and 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "# P-Value: The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed in the sample, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than α) provides evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decision Rule: A decision rule is defined based on the significance level (α). It specifies whether to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than or equal to α. If p ≤ α, you reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, you fail to reject it.\n",
